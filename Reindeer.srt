00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,434
Reindeers are better than people
Dieren zijn beter dan mensen
Animals are better than people

00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,393
Sven, don't you think that's true?
Sven, 't is waar geef toe
Sven, it's true, admit it

00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,789
"Yeah, people will beat you and curse you and cheat you"
"Ja, mensen bedriegen, ze slaan je en liegen"
"Yes, humans deceive, they slap you and lie"

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,391
"Every one of them's bad, except you!"
"Maar jij bent wel een held, man, en hoe!"
"But you are a real hero, man, and how!"

00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,354
Aw. Thanks, buddy.
Bedankt, maatje.
Thanks, buddy.

00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,999
But people smell better than reindeers
Ze ruiken wel beter dan dieren
They do smell better than animals

00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,315
Sven, don't you think I'm right?
Sven, had je dat gedacht?
Sven, did you think about that?

00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,717
"That's once again true, for all except you!"
"Dat is ook weer waar, behalve jij daar"
"That's also true, except for you"

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,029
You got me! Let's call it a night.
Betrapt! Maar nu goeienacht.
Got me! But now goodnight.

00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,959
"Good night"
"Slaap zacht"
"Sleep tight"

00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:43,151
Don't let the frostbite bite.
Hou de kou uit je hart
Keep the cold away from your heart
